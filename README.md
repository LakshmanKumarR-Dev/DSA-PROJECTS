# 🧠 DSA-PROJECTS (Python)

Hi Connections 👋  
Here are a couple of mini projects I built using **Data Structures & Algorithms** with Python. Everything is implemented **without using any shortcut libraries** (like `eval()`) — just pure DSA logic applied into practical projects!

##  Project 1: Infix to Postfix Calculator (with GUI)

A custom calculator that:
- Converts infix expressions (e.g., `2+3*4`) to postfix (`234*+`)
- Evaluates the result using **stack-based logic**
- GUI is created using **Tkinter**
- Stack operations are implemented using **collections.deque**

🛠️ DSA Concepts: Stack, Operator Precedence  
📚 Libraries: `collections`, `tkinter`  
🎯 Highlights:
- Clean GUI
- No `eval()` used
- Multiple digit input handling

📂 File: `Calculator.py`

##  Project 2: Library Management System (Console Based)

A fully functional console-based Library System that allows you to:
- Add books with title, author, ID
- Search for books
- Return & Borrow books
- Display current available books

🛠️ DSA Concepts: Linked List (Custom Singly Linked List)  
📚 Libraries: `tkinter.simpledialog` (only for GUI popup input, optional)

🎯 Highlights:
- Pure DSA-based linked list implementation
- Simple console interaction
- Input handled with optional GUI popups (for fun)

📂 File: `LibraryManagementSystem.py`
