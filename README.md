# 🧠 DSA-PROJECTS (Python)

Hi Connections 👋  
Here are a couple of mini projects I built using **Data Structures & Algorithms** with Python. Everything is implemented **without using any shortcut libraries** (like `eval()`) — just pure DSA logic applied into practical projects!
---

##  Project 1: Infix to Postfix Calculator (with GUI)

A custom calculator that:
- Converts infix expressions (e.g., `2+3*4`) to postfix (`234*+`)
- Evaluates the result using **stack-based logic**
- GUI is created using **Tkinter**
- Stack operations are implemented using **collections.deque**

🛠️ DSA Concepts: Stack, Operator Precedence  
📚 Libraries: `collections`, `tkinter`  
🎯 Highlights:
- Clean GUI
- No `eval()` used
- Multiple digit input handling

📂 File: `Calculator.py`

##  Project 2: Library Management System (Console Based)

A fully functional console-based Library System that allows you to:
- Add books with title, author, ID
- Search for books
- Return & Borrow books
- Display current available books

🛠️ DSA Concepts: Linked List (Custom Singly Linked List)  
📚 Libraries: `tkinter.simpledialog` (only for GUI popup input, optional)

🎯 Highlights:
- Pure DSA-based linked list implementation
- Simple console interaction
- Input handled with optional GUI popups (for fun)

📂 File: `LibraryManagementSystem.py`


## 💳 Project 3: Banking Management System (Using DSA Concepts)

This is a console-based **Banking Management System** built in Python. It demonstrates the use of **Data Structures** such as **Linked List** and **Stack (using `collections.deque`)** to manage customer records and transaction histories.

### ✅ Features
- Add New Customers (Stored using Linked List)
- Deposit and Withdraw Money
- Maintain Transaction History (using Stack with `deque`)
- Display All Customers
- View Global Transaction Log

### 🧠 DSA Concepts Used
- Singly Linked List: Each customer is stored as a node in a linked list.
- Stack (`collections.deque`): Used for maintaining the transaction history (LIFO).
- Object-Oriented Programming: Classes for Customer, Node, LinkedList, and Bank System.

# 📄 Plagiarism Detection System (DSA + Python)

Hi Connections 👋  
Here’s a mini project where I built a **Plagiarism Checker** using core DSA concepts like **KMP Algorithm**, **Set Operations**, and **n-gram comparison** — all implemented from scratch!

### ⚙️ Features:
- Compares two text documents
- Calculates Jaccard Similarity
- Uses KMP for pattern matching
- Shows similarity score and verdict

### 🛠️ DSA Used:
- Hashing (Set)
- KMP Algorithm
- String Preprocessing
